🧠 1. locations Table – Master Table for All Places
Purpose:
This table defines every possible geographic location involved in the bus system: bus stands, stops, terminals, boarding/drop points.

Key Columns:
name: Could be a bus stand, a more local landmark, or specific boarding point like "Near Domino’s, Andheri".

city, state: Organize locations by geography.

latitude, longitude: Enable map integrations, real-time tracking, distance calculations.

is_active: Lets you soft-disable a location if it's no longer used.

Real-Life Use Case:
When a user selects:

Source: “Gopalganj More, Siwan”

Destination: “Kashmiri Gate, New Delhi”
The system will internally map those to location_ids in this table.

🚌 2. bus_trips Table – Core Schedule: When & Where a Bus Runs
Purpose:
Represents one scheduled journey of a bus from a source to a destination — with a fixed date/time (or recurring days).

Think of this table as defining a calendar of runs for each bus.

Key Columns:
bus_id: Link to which physical bus is used.

source_location_id, destination_location_id: Where this trip starts and ends.

departure_time, arrival_time: Specific times the bus departs and arrives.

travel_date: Useful for one-time trips (e.g. a holiday special).

is_recurring, days_of_week: If true, allows repeating trips like:

“Every Mon, Wed, Fri at 6PM”

is_active: Let you disable a trip (maintenance, cancellation, etc.)

Real-Life Use Case:
Let’s say a bus runs:

Daily from Siwan (source) to Delhi (destination) at 6:00 PM.

This would be:

sql
Copy
Edit
INSERT INTO bus_trips (bus_id, source_location_id, destination_location_id, departure_time, travel_date, is_recurring, days_of_week)
VALUES (7, 3, 10, '18:00', '2025-07-31', TRUE, 'Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri,Sat,Sun');
📍 3. pickup_points Table – Where Can You Board?
Purpose:
Defines all intermediate locations where passengers can board for a specific trip.

Each pickup point is:

Attached to a trip_id

Linked to a location_id

Given a pickup_time and sort_order

Why this is powerful:
Supports multiple boarding locations for the same trip

Passengers can choose "Where to board" during booking

sort_order enables sequential display like:

Copy
Edit
🕕 6:00 PM – Gopalganj More  
🕡 6:30 PM – Siwan Bus Stand  
🕖 7:00 PM – Chhapra Bypass  
Real-Life Use Case:
When a user searches for a bus from Siwan to Delhi, they see:

“Boarding Points near you:

Siwan Kachahari (6:00 PM)

Gopalganj Bus Stand (6:45 PM)”

These come from this table.

📥 4. drop_points Table – Where Can You Get Off?
Purpose:
Defines where passengers can get off during a trip — typically within or near the destination city.

Exactly like pickup_points, but for end-of-journey locations.

Use Case:
When user searches for a bus to Delhi, they might see:

“Dropping Points:

Anand Vihar Terminal (6:30 AM)

Kashmiri Gate (7:00 AM)

Majnu Ka Tila (7:30 AM)”

This table handles that.

🔄 How It All Works Together (System Flow):
As a developer:
When a user searches for buses from Siwan to Delhi, your backend will:

Map city names to location_id from locations.

Query bus_trips where:

source_location_id = Siwan

destination_location_id = Delhi

travel_date = 'selected date'

Or match recurring days (e.g., Mon, Tue)

For each matched trip_id, fetch:

Pickup points → Show boarding options

Drop points → Show dropping options

Join with buses to show the bus name/type/seats etc.
